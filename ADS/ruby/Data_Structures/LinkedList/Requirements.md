# Linked List requirements


** All of these problems are from [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/) **

## Basic operations

- Insertion
- Search for element (Iterative and Recursive)
- Length of list (Iterative and Recursive)
- Reverse Linked List (Iterative and Recursive)
- Delete key 
- Delete position
- Delete Linked List
- Get Nth node 
- Get Nth node from the end


## Standard problems

- Easy:
    - Print the middle of a given Linked List
    - Write a function that counts the number of times a given int occurs in a Linked List
    - Check if a Linked List is Circular Linked List
    - Count nodes in Circular Linked List
    - Convert singly Linked List into Circular Linked List
    - Reverse a Doubly Linked List
    - Program to find size of Doubly Linked List
    - Method to print reverse of a Linked List
    - Can we reverse a linked list in less than O(n)
    - Circular Linked List Traversal
    - Delete a node in a Doubly Linked List
- Medium:
    - Detect loop in Linked List
    - Find length of loop in Linked List
    - Remove duplicates from a sorted Linked List
    - Intersection of two Sorted Linked Lists
    - QuickSort on singly Linked List
    - Split a circular Linked List into two halves
    - Deletion from a Circular Linked List
    - MergeSort for Doubly Linked List
    - Find pairs with given sum in Doubly Linked List
    - Insert value in sorted way in a sorted Doubly Linked List
    - Remove duplicates from an unsorted doubly linked list
    - Rotate Doubly Linked List by N nodes
    - Given only a pointer to a node to be delted in a Singly Linked List, how to delete it
    - Modify contents of Linked List
- Hard:
    - Intersection point of two Linked Lists
    - Circular Queue | Set 2 (Circular Linked List implementation)
    - Josephus Circle using Circular Linked List
    - The Great Tree-List Recursion Problem
    - Copy a Linked list with next and arbit pointer
    - Convert a given Binary Tree to Doubly Linked List 
    - Priority Queue using Doubly Linked List
    - Reverse a Doubly Linked List in groups of given size
    - Reverse a stack without using extra space in O(n)
    - Linked List representation of Disjoint Set Data Structures
    - Sublist Search (Search a Linked List in another list)
    - Construct a Linked List from 2D matrix
    - Partitioning a Linked List around a given value and if we don't care about making the elements of the list 'stable'
